Wander Console - Discover the Small Web
=======================================

**Wander** is a small, decentralised, self-hosted web console that
lets visitors to your website explore interesting websites and pages
recommended by a community of independent personal website owners.

[![Wander][IMG]][CON]

Each Wander console loads personal websites and pages recommended by
the Wander community.  Further, each Wander console can link to other
Wander consoles, forming a lightweight, decentralised network for
browsing the small web of personal websites.

Visit https://susam.net/wander/ to see an example of a Wander console.

Visit https://susam.codeberg.page/wcn/ to find a list of known Wander
consoles.

How It Works
------------

A Wander console does two things:

1. **Wander pages**: It loads a random page from a list of websites
   and pages recommended by the community.

2. **Wander consoles**: It can send the visitor to another Wander
   console on a different website, where they can continue wandering
   the Web using the new Wander console.

A Wander console is just a directory on your web server with two files:

- [index.html](index.html) - This is the HTML tool that implements the
  Wander console user interface.

- [wander.js](wander.js) - This is where you define the list of
  websites and pages you recommend and the other Wander consoles you
  want your console to link to.  The other Wander consoles you link to
  are known as the neighbours of your console.  So this file defines
  your console neighbourhood.

Together, these two files form a Wander console.  The most interesting
aspect of the Wander console is that everything happens on the
client-side, on the user's web browser.  As a website owner, you do
not need to set up any server-side components.  The only thing you
need to do is place the above two files somewhere on your web server,
preferably, at the directory `/wander/`.


Wandering the Web
-----------------

As a visitor, you begin wandering the Wander network at a Wander
console.  This might be your own console or someone else's.  For
example, you can start wandering at https://susam.net/wander/ right
now.  The console you visit is called the *base console*.  All other
consoles are known as *remote consoles*.

Once you are on a Wander console, you can click the **Wander** button
at the top left to visit websites and pages recommended by your base
console as well as remote consoles.  Your base console fetches website
recommendations from itself as well as from remote consoles and
displays them to you.

The first time you load a base console, one of the web pages
recommended by the base console owner is picked randomly and presented
to you.  The base console then discovers all the other consoles listed
in its `wander.js` file ([see example][wander.js]).  These other
consoles are known as the neighbours of the base console.  Each
console lists its neighbouring consoles in its `wander.js` file.

When you click the **Wander** button for the first time, your base
console selects one of its neighbouring consoles at random and then
chooses a page from its recommendations.  That chosen page is then
shown to you on your base console.  At the same time, the neighbours
of that console are discovered.  Throughout this process, you remain
on the base console.  You never leave it.

With each click of the **Wander** button, the base console selects a
console at random from the growing list of discovered consoles.
Specifically, it selects a console from the most recently discovered
100 consoles.  A website or web page recommended by that console is
shown to you and its neighbours are added to the list of discovered
consoles.  In this way, each hop takes you deeper and deeper into the
Wander network, while expanding the set of known remote consoles.

[wander.js]: https://susam.net/wander/wander.js


Changing Base Console
---------------------

As mentioned in the previous section, you typically do not leave the
base console while wandering the web.  However, if you wish, you can
click the **Console** button at the top to visit a neighbouring
console.  In practice, this is rarely necessary since most consoles
look similar, but you can do so if you want to explore a different
one.

Some console owners customise the appearance or behaviour of their
consoles.  You might want to change the base console to encounter such
customised consoles.  Further, different console owners maintain
different ignore lists that define which websites must never appear on
their console.  An ignore list ([see example][wander.js]) typically
contains commercial websites that do not fit the spirit of the small
web, as well as defunct or incompatible websites that do not load in
the console.  A console with a well maintained *ignore* list ensures
that a visitor to that console has a lower likelihood of encountering
commercial or broken websites.  So another reason for changing your
base console is to use one with a better ignore list.


Install
-------

Here are the steps to set up Wander Console on your website:

1. Download the Wander bundle from one of the following locations:

   - https://codeberg.org/susam/wander/archive/wander.zip
   - https://github.com/susam/wander/archive/wander.zip

   Both links provide identical copies of the bundle.  If one link
   does not work, say due to service issues, try the other link.

2. Extract the following files:

   - `index.html`
   - `wander.js`

3. Place the the two files somewhere on your website, preferrably at
   the `/wander/` path, for example:

   ```
   wander/
   ├── index.html
   └── wander.js
   ```

4. Open `wander.js` and edit the following JavaScript object:

   ```javascript
   const wander = {
     consoles: [],
     pages: [],
   }
   ```

   Please see https://susam.net/wander/wander.js for an example.

   The value for the `consoles` property is a list of console URLs
   that you want to link to from your console.  This defines your
   console's neighbourhood.  When a user visits your console, it
   fetches the `wander.js` files of these neighbouring consoles to
   discover website recommendations.  These console links are also
   shown when the user clicks the **Console** button on your console.
   Further, when another console reaches your console while exploring
   the network, it follows these links to discover recommendations
   from your neighbourhood.

   The value for the `pages` property is a list of websites and pages
   that you want to recommend to the Wander community.  When a user
   visits your console, a recommendation is chosen at random from this
   list and displayed.  Likewise, when another console reaches your
   console, it uses this list to pick a recommendation at random and
   present it to its user.

6. Once your console is live, share it with others in the following
   community thread: <https://codeberg.org/susam/wander/issues/1>.

   Hopefully, someone will link to your console and then visitors to
   their console may receive recommendations from your `wander.js`.

**Tip:** Do not edit the `index.html` file directly.  Keeping your
`index.html` unmodified makes it easier to update your Wander Console
UI by downloading new versions of `index.html` and replacing the
existing file.  If you want to customise the Wander Console UI, follow
the instructions in [Customise Your Console](#customise-your-console).


Customise Your Console
----------------------

You can customise the look and feel of your console by adding custom
CSS files.  You can also customise the functionality of your console
by adding custom JavaScript files.  Further, you can customise which
URLs your console should never load.


### Custom CSS

To add a custom stylesheet, say, `style.css` to your console, edit
your `wander.js` file and add a `styles` property:

```javascript
const wander = {
  consoles: [
    // ...
  ],
  pages: [
    // ...
  ],
  styles: [
    'style.css',
  ]
}
```

The value of the `styles` property is a list of CSS filenames.  These
filenames may be paths relative to your `index.html` or absolute URLs.


### Custom JS

Similarly, to add a custom script, say, `script.js`, add a `scripts`
property:

```javascript
const wander = {
  consoles: [
    // ...
  ],
  pages: [
    // ...
  ],
  scripts: [
    'script.js',
  ]
}
```

The value of the `scripts` property is a list of JavaScript filenames.
These filenames may be paths relative to your `index.html` or absolute
URLs.


### Customise Ignore List

To block certain URLs from loading on your console, add or edit the
`ignores` property:

```javascript
const wander = {
  consoles: [
    // ...
  ],
  pages: [
    // ...
  ],
  ignore: [
    'https://example.com/',
    'https://example.net/foo/',
  ]
}
```

Each entry in the ignore list represents a *wildcard pseudo-prefix
pattern* that console and page URLs are matched against.  If a console
URL or a web page URL matches one of the given wildcard prefix
patterns, your console will never load it.

Let us elaborate how the wildcard pseudo-prefix pattern works.  To
check whether a URL matches a pattern, the following normalisation is
done on both the URL and the pattern:

1. The protocol is removed from the beginning.
2. Query parameters and fragment identifiers are removed from the end.
3. The remainder is converted to lowercase.
4. A trailing forward slash is added if it does not already exist.

After normalisation, the pattern is interpreted as a wildcard pattern
where any asterisk (`*`) matches zero or more arbitrary characters in
the normalised URL.

A URL is considered to match a pattern if the normalised pattern
matches the beginning of the normalised URL.  This peculiar matching
algorithm has some desirable effects and some counterintuitive ones:

 - An ignore pattern `https://example.com/` ignores all of the
    following URLs:

    ```
    http://example.com/
    https://example.com/
    https://example.com/foo/
    ftp://example.com/
    ```

 - An ignore pattern `https://example.com/foo` ignores all of the
    following URLs:

    ```
    https://example.com/foo
    https://example.com/foo/
    https://example.com/foo/bar
    ```

    But counterintuitively, it does not ignore the URL
    `https://example.com/foobar` because the normalised pattern
    `example.com/foo/` is not a prefix of the normalised URL
    `example.com/foobar/`.

  - An ignore pattern `https://example.com/foo/` is equivalent to the
    previous one.  This one makes it more obvious why it doesn't match
    `https://example.com/foobar`.

  - An ignore pattern `https://example.com/foo?p=hello` matches all of
    the following URLs:

    ```
    https://example.com/foo
    https://example.com/foo/
    https://example.com/foo?p=world
    https://example.com/foo#chapter1
    https://example.com/foo/bar/
    ```

    In practice, there is usually no need to use a pattern like this.
    The simpler pattern `https://example.com/foo/` behaves the same
    and is clearer.

  - An ignore pattern `https://example.com/foo/#world` is equivalent
    to the previous one.  As before, the simpler pattern
    `https://example.com/foo/` behaves the same and is clearer.

  - An ignore pattern `https://*.example.com/` matches all of the
    following URLs:

    ```
    https://foo.example.com/
    https://bar.example.com/baz
    https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://foo.example.com/
    ```

  - An ignore pattern `httpS://Example.COM/Foo` matches all of the
    following URLs:

    ```
    https://example.com/foo
    HTTPS://EXAMPLE.COM/FOO
    Https://EXAMPLE.com/foO
    ```

The last example demonstrates that prefix matching is
case-insensitive.  This can be counterintuitive because a URL like
`https://example.com/foo` would match `https://example.com/FOO` as
well, even though it is quite possible that they are two distinct
pages serving different content.

An alternative approach would be to perform case-insensitive matching
only for the domain part and case-sensitive matching for the
remainder.  However, we have decided to go with the above algorithm
for the sake of simplicity and brevity in both code and documentation.
This algorithm takes only 8 lines to implement.  A more sophisticated
solution that feels more intuitive for all edge cases would take
significantly more code and would also take longer to explain.


### Customise 'via' Parameter

#### Default Behaviour

Since version 0.4.0, Wander Console appends a `via=` query parameter
when loading a recommended page in the console.  For example, if you
encounter `https://midnight.pub/` while using a console at
`https://console.example/wander/`, the console loads the page as:

```
https://midnight.pub/?via=https://console.example/wander/
```

This allows the owner of the recommended website to see, via their
access logs, that the visit originated from a Wander Console.  This is
the default behaviour but can be customised.


#### Pass Name and Version Instead

You can configure your Wander Console to send only the project
identifier (name and version), e.g. `via=wander-0.4.0`, instead of the
full console URL.  To do this, set `referral` to `'version'` in your
`wander.js` file:

```javascript
const wander = {
  consoles: [
    // ...
  ],
  pages: [
    // ...
  ],
  referral: 'version',
}
```

Now the console will load pages using URLs like:

```
https://midnight.pub/?via=wander-0.4.0
```

In this mode, website owners can still recognise Wander traffic but
cannot see the full URL of your console.  This may prevent them from
discovering your console.  However, with other signals such as the
HTTP referrer header, they may still be able to infer its URL.


### Disable 'Via' Parameter

To disable the `via=` parameter entirely, set `referral` to `'no'`:

```javascript
const wander = {
  consoles: [
    // ...
  ],
  pages: [
    // ...
  ],
  referral: 'no',
}
```

Now pages are loaded using their original URLs:

```
https://midnight.pub/
```

In this mode, no referral information is shared with the destination
website.  As a result, your Wander console is less likely to be
discovered through access logs.  That said, other signals such as the
HTTP referrer header may still reveal clues about its URL.


### Customisation Order

Customisation files are loaded in the following order:

1. The console's own built-in stylesheet and script load first.
2. Then the console loads all the custom stylesheets in the order
   specified.
3. Then it loads all the custom scripts in the order specified.
4. Finally, it sets up the console with a randomly chosen website.

Prefer using this customisation mechanism to customise your console.
This allows you to keep your `index.html` unmodified, which makes it
easier to upgrade your Wander Console UI simply by downloading a new
copy of the file and replacing your existing one.


Caution
-------

When adding links to your console, you might want to check if each
console loads successfully within the console.  Some websites set the
`X-Frame-Options` HTTP header or the `frame-ancestors` directive in
their `Content-Security-Policy` header to prevent their pages from
being embedded in other websites.  Such pages will not load inside the
Wander console.

Adding such links to your `wander.js` can disrupt the wandering
experience for users of the Wander network.

To test a link, open https://susam.net/wander/ (or your own Wander
console), paste the link into the URL textbox (the text input field)
and click **Go**.  If the link loads within the console, it is safe to
include.  If it does not, please avoid adding it to your `wander.js`.


Wander Console Network
----------------------

Due to the distributed nature of the network, it is difficult to
maintain a complete list of all Wander consoles.  However, we make a
best effort to keep track of known consoles.  The current list of
known consoles is available at:

- https://susam.codeberg.page/wcn/
- https://susam.github.io/wcn/

This list is generated from time to time by a tiny crawler project
maintained at <https://codeberg.org/susam/wcn>.

Further, you can crawl the network from your console or any given
console by clicking the **Console** button in the top navigation bar
and then selecting **Crawl**.  Doing so will show only the portion of
the network that is reachable from that console.


Design
------

One of the design goals with Wander has been to keep it fully
decentralised, similar to the Web itself.  I have tried to avoid
having any centralised list of URLs or seed nodes.  Each Wander
console is just a small, self-hosted node made up of two static files.
Anyone can run it on their own website, define the pages they
recommend and link to other consoles as neighbours.  All Wander
consoles are equal participants from a technical perspective.  None of
them act as a canonical source of seed URLs.  The network is defined
entirely by these independently hosted consoles.  A visitor can start
from any one of them and browse the network.  With each click, the
console tool simply follows the console neighbourhood from one console
to another and loads the recommended pages it discovers.


Comparisons
-----------

Wander is often compared to other projects and trends like webrings,
Kagi Small Web and StumbleUpon.  There is indeed a lot of similarity
between Wander and such projects.  After all, each such service has
been an inspiration behind Wander.  While there is a lot of similarity
with such services, there are some differences as well.  These
differences are noted in the following subsections.


### Wander vs Kagi Small Web

[Kagi Small Web][kagi] currently accepts only blogs, comics and
YouTube channels.  It does not accept arbitrary small websites.  In
fact, it was this particular limitation that motivated me to build
Wander.

Unlike Kagi Small Web, there is no central list of URLs in Wander.
Each participant hosts their own Wander console along with their own
list of favourite URLs.  You can begin browsing the network from any
console.  The pages you see are pulled from that console, the consoles
it links to and so on recursively.

[kagi]: https://kagi.com/smallweb/


### Wander vs StumbleUpon

Wander has similarities to [StumbleUpon][stumble] as well but unlike
StumbleUpon there is no central service.  The Wander network lives
entirely on independent personal websites maintained by individuals.
The pages shown in a console come directly from such Wander consoles
that belong to individual personal website owners.


### Wander vs Webrings

Wander is similar to webrings in spirit, but differs in structure.  A
typical webring forms a cycle, where each site links to a fixed next
and previous site.  In Wander, the network graph is arbitrary.  Each
instance can link to any number of pages and other instances.

There is no central list and no ring maintainer deciding how sites are
connected.  With Wander, *you* decide which pages to recommend and
which other consoles to link to.  This means you are in full control
of your recommendations and your Wander neighbourhood.

Join the Community
------------------

### Share Your Console

If you have set up a Wander Console on your website, please share a
link to it in the following community thread:
<https://codeberg.org/susam/wander/issues/1>.

Doing so helps other members of the community learn about the
existence of your console and link to it from their own consoles.


### Join Our IRC Channel

We have an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel where you can meet and
greet other members of the Wander Console community.  If you are new
to IRC, you can join the channel using the following web gateway:
[web.libera.chat/#wander][webchat].

If you use an IRC client, connect to `irc.libera.chat` (port 6667 for
plaintext or 6697 for TLS) and then run `/join #wander`.

This channel is for people who enjoy building personal websites and
want to talk to each other.  You are welcome to share your Wander
Console URL, link to your website or your recent articles as well as
links to other non-commercial personal websites.

Contributing
------------

Here are a few things to keep in mind when submitting fixes and
improvements:

 1. Please create a new pull request for your contribution.

 2. Run `make deps` and `make checks` to catch code style issues
    before sending your pull request.  If you do not have `make`,
    refer to the [Makefile](Makefile) and run the commands for `deps`
    and `checks` manually.

 3. Please read [Writing Good Commit Messages][otp-wiki] and follow
    the recommendations there.  Here are some important things to
    check before sending a pull request:

    - Limit the first line of the commit message to 50 characters.

    - If a second line is present, it must be blank.

    - You may include a more detailed explanation starting from the
      third line.  This is optional.

    - If you include a detailed explanation, ensure that each line is
      no longer than 72 characters.  Hard-wrap the text by inserting
      line breaks.  In Vim, you can use `:set tw=72` and reflow text
      with `gq`.  In Emacs, use `M-q` to reformat a paragraph.  For
      other editors, refer to their documentation.  If your editor
      does not support automatic hard-wrapping, you may need to wrap
      lines manually.

    - Use proper capitalisation, punctuation and complete sentences.

    These guidelines may feel old-fashioned, but they are the
    conventions I follow.  I am more particular about commit messages
    than I am about code: code can be fixed in a later commit but
    commit messages cannot be changed once merged.  Fixing them
    requires rewriting commit history, which I want to avoid.
    Therefore, please ensure the commit message is in good shape when
    submitting a pull request.

 3. I know my code is not the most modern way to write JavaScript.
    Still, I would appreciate it if any new code follows the existing
    style as much as possible.

 4. After opening a pull request, please be patient.  I have a very
    busy schedule and cannot review changes quickly.  I am currently
    busy with a few academical pursuits, so I will have limited time
    to collaborate on pull requests until June 2026.  I will still try
    to review submissions whenever I can during breaks.  (This tool
    itself was written during one such break.)

 5. The smaller the change, the easier it will be for me to review and
    merge the changes.

 6. I may not merge every change, so please keep that in mind when
    deciding how much time to invest in a contribution.  I do not want
    you to feel too disappointed if a change is not merged.  I
    generally recommend making changes that are first and foremost
    useful to *you*.  That way, even if your contribution is not
    merged, it will still be valuable to you and something you can
    continue using for yourself.
