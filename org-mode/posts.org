*Small info/log on my linux journey and my experience.*

/If you are reading this, I encourage you to write blogs like this and have it in your git repo. Don't forget to tag or inform me, I'd be glad to read your journey too!/

-----

*** The Embark

My linux journey was from Linux Mint > EndeavourOS > Arch Linux > and now NixOS.

Tbh I loved LM and Arch alot, I was a devotee to Arch too, and I hated Nix when I tried, cause things were weird.
+ You won't know where to start nor what to refer
+ Flakes or home-manager, How to understand?
+ Do nix-env or rebuild all the time?
+ What files to edit to achieve same setup as my previous distro?

  These were all the things that I hated and was frustrated about, there was still many things that felt hard.
  I did leave Nix and install Arch few times back and forth, I was debating with myself and id my own research all over Internet.

  That is when I thought nix lacked Documentation or good YouTuber to speak of, I really wish one of them could explain and make it their distro to explain timely on things.

  Fine, somehow forced myself and came a long way of setting up Good working nixos config, now I'm on flakes.

  Nix is great if it works as expected or if we make it work, but, if I get stuck or the issue goes for days that is when I really hate Nix, because it ain't easy to solve some unique issues. Most of these apply for HomeManager actually, it adds more trouble.

  It is adviced to learn how Nix works or Nix as Functional Programming Language.

Introduction part, you would better have read it on official nixos site ([[https://nixos.org]])

*** "Should you try NixOS?" ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Here answer from a non-programmer, who just browses and watches media.
Just don't, if you are looking for small benefit. *Don't!*
 regret having hard time to figure out petty things, again forget about error, you cannot even search in web.

But, if you have decided, go with it. According to me (non-programmer), these points are good to consider NixOS
 + You use Emacs (lol), *Emacs* ‚ù§Ô∏è  *Nix* is Match made in Heaven.
 + You want to declare stuffs and get same output, and forget what all you setup, cause its all declared in config.
 + You want an isolated environments (shell) to do some stuffs without involving whole system.
 + You want to stop troubleshooting and breaking update and are lazy to backup, and want to rollback with ease like with just a reboot.
 + You want to say I use *Nixos Btw*.
 + You don't want to worry about breaking your system nor fix something when you are updating system.
 + You are willing to learn (advanced) things and fine with steep learning curve.

*** How I manage my system üå≤

I manage my whole system with single org file. Its easy and pretty handy. You can read that file here *‚Ü¨* [[https://github.com/idlip/d-nix/blob/onepiece/d-setup.org][d-setup.org]] , its both self documenting and has all source code blocks.

Another key feature in my setup is, every file i tangle is at *read-only mode*. So generally we can avoid editing/touching them. Thus, every action has to be made in *d-setup.org* only.

Also, I have made files to be *symlink*, so i can edit them without requiring to rebuild whole thing!

--------------


**** Credits üéñÔ∏è

These configs were the inspiration and helped to build this way.

I thank them sincerely.

[[https://github.com/Iron-Shark/Technonomicon][Iron Shark]] *‚üπ* Made migrating to Single org-file config very easy.

[[https://github.com/sioodmy/dotfiles][Sioodmy]] *‚üπ* First config which I understand thoroughly and modified based on this.

** Imposter Syndrome : Formula for Success :phenomenon:success:skill:imposter:psychology:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: imposter-syndrome
:EXPORT_DATE: 2023-03-24

:END:

- Have you ever felt a fear of losing or doubt your own ability?
- Have you felt unworthy, lost your self esteem due to a mistake?
- Are you feeling constant fear of being discovered rather than being proud?

The matter is, is these sound true or happening at some moment, let me condition it as *"Imposted Syndrome"*.

You might remember the word "Imposter" from the most popular mobile game during lockdown, *Among us* ([[https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/][site]]), yeah as the name suggests it means one who deceives.

But imposter syndrome is seriously for real, a condition, which people do experience in their life. They don't usually realize or find its symptoms as it is in itself a _negative feeling_, provoking [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/anxiety][anxiety]] and [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/fear][fear]].


    + People with imposter syndrome feel inauthentic, question their own ability to be
    successful, and are convinced that they do not belong in the roles they stand, even
    when they experience success.

I myself have felt this, when I was starting out journey to learn new course (say programming language), I felt it was oceanic knowledge where I only had a boat.

*** Ways to stop Imposter Syndrome

#+begin_quote
/Where there is a will, there is a way./
#+end_quote


**** Trust the Process

   Reflect on your actions, see the world praising you. Instead of listening to the negative feeling from your head, listen to the feedback from others.

   - Others believe in you
   - You don't believe in yourself
   - Yet you believe yourself instead of them

   If you doubt yourself, shouldn't you also doubt your judgment of yourself?

**** Look for Evidence

   Fine you feel it that way, see if you can find evidence and measures. Think of some example where you have made some positive impact on others, how much change have you brought them.

**** Remember the Journey

   Look back at the steps you have taken, how was the process of learning from scratch, rock-bottom.

   /'It will get better and you'll be more proud of yourself.'/

**** Turn the Tables

   Make it a strenth, refrain from doubts. Those with imposter syndrome are more likely to say "I don't know" when they don't know. This is an advantage. Overconfident people assume they have all the answers, even when they don't.

    Humility, uncertainty, and self-doubt are part of the learning process. The key is to believe in your ability to learn.

This is straight away from [[https://github.com/VernonGrant/discovering-emacs][VernonGrant]] who hosts a podcast for Emacs called "[[https://www.discovering-emacs.com/][Discovering-Emacs]]".
It's a great and has very much professional vibes, the explanations are Crisp and Clear!
I suggest you to check out, he even has made [[https://www.youtube.com/@discoveringemacs][YouTube channel]] for it.

I have removed some of the common bindings from this table, I have retained some unique one's which isn't discovered generally. I guess that is why the name is made (lol)

I just wanted to have a cheatsheet for it, so I decided to leave it as a post here.
