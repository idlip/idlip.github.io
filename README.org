The Journey begins..

You know its fascinating to have a personal static website which is rich and valuable for others.

I went with Hugo and ox-hugo which is a match that exists only for Emacs (GOAT) to build the site.

I have forked the theme from [[https://rudra.dev]] , and adjusted colors to my liking.


I hope its a soothing experience for you to read!
