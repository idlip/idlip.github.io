Re-wrote initial setup using =org-publish=

-----

You know its fascinating to have a personal static website which is rich and valuable for others.

-----

*** Sites I found using org-publish

- https://ogbe.net/
- https://taingram.org/
- https://pavpanchekha.com/blog.html
- https://patrickdelliott.com/
- https://www.danliden.com/
- https://systemcrafters.net/ (obviously, the Youtuber who taught us!)


I hope its a soothing experience for you to read!

*** Notes
- You need to give read and write permission for the github CI to work.
  - As it needs to update gh-pages.

- Previously I was using hugo, by wonder support for org export =ox-hugo=, but I was not learning anything, you just choose a hugo theme, and there you go.
  - I went with Hugo and ox-hugo which is a match that exists only for Emacs (GOAT) to build the site.
  - I had forked the theme from [[https://rudra.dev]] , and adjusted colors to my liking.
  - Since I wanted to learn and know things that are behind the site, just trying =org-publish=.


*** Ideas - TODO
**** Improvements for Sites [0/2]
- [ ] More better sitemap?
  - One with small gist and proper format, bonus with tags.
- [ ] Make posts filter via tags. (looks hard)

:END:

**** TODO Art of note taking :snippet:

**** TODO Actual way of getting things done :snippet:

**** DONE Try if one.el is good enough for this site
- Pros: emacs
- refer: https://github.com/tonyaldon/one.el
- This lead me to dive into ~org-publish~.

**** TODO Integrate denote as blogging system
- It is possible to go with identifier as base, and so interlinking should work.

**** TODO Preparation for sharing slides
- Using org-re-reveal, try to embed resources in single file.
- Either keep html and attach it as statics or use =org-re-reveal-publish-to-reveal=
