Before anyone shouts vim, let me `:q!`
I was a vimmer for a year, I played and had a good basic config. Even after an year, I didn't grasp the full potential of vim, it was just handy to use `hjkl` to move around.

But When I'm learning Emacs, the experience is immense, it defines how things are meant and the legacy of Emacs for 40 years, is not a joke.

I cannot just rant to make people ditch vim for Emacs, But once you understand you will realize, that is my friend people went and made `evil` mode to emulate Vi layer (vim 100%).

Now they get the **Best** of both the World!

Nonetheless, Emacs is the **GOAT** !
