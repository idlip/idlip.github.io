Although I don't use vim, it has good points for being easy **keyboard glue**. Why not learn both of the best worlds of Editors?

Apart from normal vim navigations and operators, These are some of the unique vim magics, which I haven't used at all.


## Marks {#marks}

This is the important one, I have not used this at all. Should try and make use of it. Although emacs `mark-ring` is alot better.
