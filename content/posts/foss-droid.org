** Code is Source :fossdroid:android:

As we know, Android is widely popular OS for many phone. But these days its all filled with junks and bloated apps, these are to say so called *"Popular Android Apps"* or *"Trending Apps"*. The reason simply would be "everyone in my circle uses it" or "I use it because _they_ use it".

But surely you are not giving yourself some privacy or *space* that you need for your own *personal phone*.
I'm talking about using Free/Libre and Open Source (FOSS) Apps. Free doesn't mean by price, Free means *Freedom*. Freedom that comes with :
  - No Trackers.
  - No Ads.
  - Minimal permission.
  - Has customization to users need.
  - No Restrictions.

These can be achieved in this modern time, by Discovering and using FOSS Apps, the best place being [[https://f-droid.org][F-droid]]  or [[https://libreddit.kavin.rocks/r/fossdroid][r/fossdroid]].

There are pretty much all apps under FOSS area for every purpose, they are good looking with *Modern UI*, *Lots of Customizations* and *friendly with Battery*.

I happened to search for book and novel reader and found very good apps there, like QuickNovel.
There is a Manga reader and lots more for every purpose.

I exclusively use every apps from F-droid, because they are great.
You should also use it, as you might find something interesting and surely, gets Surprised; and say in your head, */Gosh I should have known this before/*.
